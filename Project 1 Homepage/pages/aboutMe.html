           <p>My name is Thais and I live in Brazil. I graduated as an Electrical Engineer but I decided to change to Computer Science. At the moment, I am taking a few courses to learn coding, logic programming, and the fundamentals of computer science. At the same time, I am building projects in order to practice what I have been learning.</p>
